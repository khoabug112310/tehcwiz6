        <p className="tagline">
          I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîbefore 2020, I wasn‚Äôt exactly a pet person. The idea of
          having a furry friend around seemed like a lot of work, and I just
          didn‚Äôt see myself as a pet owner. But then, COVID happened, and like
          many, I found myself stuck at home with way too much time on my hands.
          The loneliness started to creep in, and that‚Äôs when we decided to take
          the plunge and get a dog. Enter Coco, the male Labrador who turned my
          world upside down. When I first brought Coco into my life, I was on
          cloud nine. But let me tell you, Coco is no ordinary dog‚Äîhe‚Äôs a
          walking contradiction. One minute, he‚Äôs zooming around the house like
          a tiny tornado, and the next, he‚Äôs sprawled out on the floor, snoring
          louder than a freight train. As for his eating habits? Total mystery.
          He‚Äôs a foodie who can go from begging for treats to turning his nose
          up at gourmet meals faster than you can say ‚Äúgood boy.‚Äù
